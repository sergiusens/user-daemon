* Introduction

A very simple example for dropping to the snap_daemon system user
from a snap based on the Snapcraft documention for [[https://snapcraft.io/docs/system-usernames][System Usernames]].

The same http server is run on different ports (8000 and 8080)

This is an alternative to the [[https://git.launchpad.net/~jdstrand/+git/test-setgroups/tree/?_ga=2.35717088.1377426695.1580817447-1051580855.1578004882][documented]] example using =LD_PRELOAD=.

** Setting up

   At the time of this writing, you can get the =system-user= functionality
   by using Snapcraft from the =edge= channel.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   $ snap install snapcraft --edge --classic
   #+END_EXAMPLE
   
   The proceed to build
   
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   $ git clone https://github.com/sergiusens/user-daemon
   $ cd user-daemon
   $ snapcraft
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   And finally install
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   $ snap install --dangerous user-daemon_*.snap
   #+END_EXAMPLE
   
** Trying it out
   Use a browser or =curl= to hit http://localhost:8000 and http://localhost:8080
   
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   $ snapcraft-user-daemon # curl http://localhost:8000
   snap_daemon (584788)
   $ snapcraft-user-daemon # curl http://localhost:8080
   root (0)
   #+END_EXAMPLE
